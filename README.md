## What is the Aviator Game?

**Aviator** is a thrilling casino game developed by **Spribe**,
featuring the popular **Crash Game** mechanic. In Aviator, players place
bets on a flight of a virtual plane. The longer the plane stays in the
air, the higher the multiplier grows, but if the plane crashes too
early, the bet is lost. The goal is to cash out your bet before the
plane crashes, with the aim of multiplying your stake by the flight\'s
multiplier.

Since its launch in 2019, Aviator has gained widespread popularity due
to its simplicity, quick rounds, and high volatility, making it perfect
for players who enjoy fast-paced games with the potential for big wins.
